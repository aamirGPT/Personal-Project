                    A little bit about me, I am a software developer. A fresh
                    pass out of MCA batch 2022 from Narsee Monjee Institute of
                    Management Studies (NMIMS Mumbai).<br /><br />I created this
                    portfolio webpage using good Ol' technologies that is HTML5,
                    CSS and JavaScript.<br /><br />As you can see, it's not that
                    very attractive but it is hardwork rather than just ctrl+c
                    and ctrl+v lol. The guides that I referred to make this are
                    StackOverflow, ChatGPT and the learnings I learnt through my
                    internships.<br /><br />
                    Let's see how this all started...

                    After going through thick and thin, enjoying and sometimes
                    getting bullied I passed my grade 10 with 64.40% from St.
                    Xavier's High School affiliated with The Maharashtra State
                    Board of Secondary & Higher Secondary Education in 2014.
                    Well it was enough for me considering the amount of studies
                    I did to back that up. I was more into 'go with the flow'
                    kind of a guy.<br /><br />
                    I haven't been a very social person throughout my life and
                    so I spent the next two years again goofing around with a
                    friend whom I met in my Abhinav Junior College. We had three
                    streams to choose from; Science, Commerce and Arts. I
                    proceeded with commerce and took IT as my optional subject
                    because I saw myself good with computers lol. Then my finals
                    of Grade 10+2 arrived in 2016 and I passed out with decent
                    61.08%. I gotta admit I still miss those days.<br /><br />
                    With not much thinking I decided to go for Bachelors of
                    Science in Information Technology as Software Engineers were
                    very high in demand during those years, It was a three year
                    course, which was meant to teach students fundamentals of
                    programming and how to program programming concepts in
                    languages such as C, C++, Java, Python, HTML, CSS,
                    JavaScript, etc. and ~boy I was so confused at it. I somehow
                    managed to clear the bachelors in 2019 with CGPA 6.22 out of
                    10.00 as I was not that great at programming and the
                    teaching methods never really painted a picture of the
                    topics inside my brain.<br /><br />
                    A year went by as I was searching for jobs as a software
                    developer it was tough to land one with no real programming
                    skills. And to my aid Covid 19 outbreak happened. It imposed
                    a country wide lockdown for a couple of months which gave me
                    quite some time to get my mind clear about my career, let's
                    consider that as my break period. It was time to learn for
                    real this time and get started with my career. After my
                    friend and I from degree college discussed that it was time
                    to make up for the time we wasted, we decided to enroll for
                    a Masters Degree. <br /><br />
                    We chose Master's of Computer Application at Narsee Monjee
                    Institute of Management Studies University (Mumbai). Now
                    this was a two year course which was completed almost
                    online. It is a rigourous course that made us create
                    projects as final submissions for each subject. It really
                    helped me grasp the basics well and I was making progress in
                    learning as I implemented them in my projects. The languages
                    I actually learned this time were C++, Java, Python, MySQL,
                    Web Development Core Languages, Android Development, with
                    projects developed in each language as final submissions.
                    Unfortunately, I had no real time experience in using Github
                    so the only place I know those projects are now available on
                    is in college archives and my memories. ~Well 3 out of 4
                    semesters were just academics with projects submitted to our
                    teachers, however the last semester was our internships that
                    we landed with our on-campus interviews. I managed to land
                    two internships / job offers through my masters with actual
                    knowledge on how to write programs other than "Hello
                    World!".
